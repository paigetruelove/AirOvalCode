# AirOvalCode

Hello, I'm Paige and this is the code behind my @AirOval Twitter bot account - which publishes information about the air quality in my local area. 
Here, you can find the code which goes into making both the daily and weekly graphs, as well as the PM concentration index (i.e. the gauge). 

This is a hobby project, so I am using a SDS011 home air quality sensor which feeds data into a Raspberry Pi. As I have an MSc in Climate Science, air quality is an issue close to my heart, and this project has been a great way for me to learn Python and a bit more about Data Science!
